# Basic Next.js Example

This directory contains a simple example of how to use the Nami Web SDK with a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application (this was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)).

## Getting Started

## Usage

This example demonstrates how to initialize the Nami SDK and launch a paywall.

You will need to replace `APP_PLATFORM_ID` and `'YOUR_PLACEMENT_LABEL'` in src/Paywall.tsx with your actual App Platform ID and placement label.

1. Install the dependencies via NPM or Yarn:

```bash
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```

2. Start the application via NPM or Yarn:


```bash
npm dev
# OR
yarn dev
```

This will start a local server and you can view the application in your web browser: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
