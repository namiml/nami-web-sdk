# Vanilla JS Example

This directory contains a simple example of how to use the Nami Web SDK with a vanilla JavaScript application.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `src/`: This directory contains the JavaScript source code.
  - `index.js`: The main JavaScript file.

## Usage

This example demonstrates how to initialize the Nami SDK and launch a paywall. 

You will need to replace `APP_PLATFORM_ID` and `'YOUR_PLACEMENT_LABEL'` in src/index.js with your actual App Platform ID and placement label.

## Start the application

```
npm start
```

```
yarn start
```

This will start a local server and open the application in your web browser.
